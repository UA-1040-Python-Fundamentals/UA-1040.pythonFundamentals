# Print all odd numbers less than 100.
# (write two versions of the code:
# one using the continue operator,
# and
# the other without this operator).

# first version
# x = 0
# while x < 100:
#     x += 1
#     if x % 2 == 0:
#         continue

    # print(x)

# second version
# c = 0
# while c < 101 and c % 2 != 0:
#     print(c)

# for i in range(101):
#     if i % 2 != 0:
#         print(i)
#         i += 2
