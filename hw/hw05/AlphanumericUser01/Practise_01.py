# Print all even numbers less than 100
# (write two variants of the code:
# one using the while loop,
# and
# the other using the for loop).

# first variant
# x = 0
# while x < 101:
#     if x%2 == 0:
#         print(x)
#     x += 1

#second variant
# for i in range (101):
#     if  i%2 == 0:
#         print(i)
